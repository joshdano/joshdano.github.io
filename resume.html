	<h1>resume.</h1>
	<p style="text-align: center;">I am seeking opportunities in front- and back-end development to increase efficiency and effectiveness of software in healthcare and/or education. Feel free to scroll through this page to get a glimpse of my educational and experiential background. You also can find a condensed and shortened PDF version of my experiences <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pB-twXnE5dFRmQZlVi86LEOJkViK3cIb/view?usp=sharing"><span style="color: #dcc7aa">here</span></a>.</p>

	<h3>education</h3>

	<p>I am a student of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia, which has challenged me intellectually as well as academically. I currently hold a 3.74 GPA on the 4.0 scale and have been awarded Dean's List twice. I anticipate to graduate in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Global Public Health.</p><br>
	<p>My two interdisciplinary majors challenge me to discover the intersection of computer science and healthcare, questioning how software and technology can be implemented in order to promote accessibility to healthcare services and products. I have also had the opportunity to explore a range of disciplines within the University, including Religion, Spanish, and even Psychology.</p>
