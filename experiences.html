	<h1>my experiences.</h1>
	<p style="text-align: center;">I am seeking opportunities in front- and back-end development to increase efficiency and effectiveness of software in healthcare and/or education. Feel free to scroll through this page to get a glimpse of my educational and experiential background. You also can find a condensed and shortened PDF version of my experiences, better known as a resume, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pB-twXnE5dFRmQZlVi86LEOJkViK3cIb/view?usp=sharing"><span style="color: #dcc7aa">here</span></a>.</p>

	<h3>education</h3>

	<p>I am a student of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia, which has challenged me intellectually as well as academically. I currently hold a 3.74 GPA on the 4.0 scale and have been awarded Dean's List twice. I anticipate to graduate in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Global Public Health.</p><br>
	<p>My two interdisciplinary majors challenge me to discover the intersection of computer science and healthcare, questioning how software and technology can be implemented in order to promote accessibility to healthcare services and products. I have also had the opportunity to explore a range of disciplines within the University, including Religion, Spanish, and even Psychology.</p>

	<h3>employment</h3>
	<h6>undergraduate teaching assistant</h6>
	<p>I currently serve as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Programming (CS 1110/1111). In this position, I serve as a mentor to beginner computer science students through grading their projects, holding office hours, and giving aid during weekly laboratory sections. Topics of the course include Python syntax, functions, data types, regular expressions, and debugging.</p>

	<h3>involvements</h3>
	<p>I strive to be an active member within the Virginia Beach and Charlottesville & UVA communities. My interests lie in cultural, educational, and community service based groups.</p>
	<h6>organization of young filipino americans</h6>
	<p>The Organization of Young Filipino Americans is a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO) at the University of Virginia. Founded in 1988, it serves to highlight the Filipino and Filipino-American identity. OYFA typically has over 200 members per year, hosting 100+ events, with its annual culture show - Barrio - as the culmination of the academic year. While OYFA aims to spread awareness of the Filipino culture, it also emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusivity in all forms.</p><br>

	<p>I currently serve as the <i>President</i> of OYFA. In this position, I strive to lead OYFA towards reuniting with its founding mission as well as with external organizations, to connect our members with the opportunites that are available to them in the greater UVA and Charlottesville communities, and to unite the Executive Board and Council with the general members of OYFA.</p><br>

	<p>During the 2019-2020 academic year, I served as the <i>Culture Chair</i>, which serves to coordinate the organization's annual culture show, Barrio. In this position, I researched the President Marcos' regime and its impacts on the Philippine economy, culture, and government. I also wrote a 20+ page piece on this topic to be performed on the day of the event. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Barrio 2020 had to be canceled.</p>

	<h6>virginia beach leadership workshop</h6>
	<p>The Virginia Beach Leadership Workshop was founded in 1974 and is an week-long summer camp that teaches middle and high school students on leadership development, growth mindset, and decision making. Before becoming a staff member, I attended as a student in 2013, 2016, and 2017.</p><br>

	<p>I have served the Virginia Beach Leadership Workshop during the 2018 and 2019 summers. As a staff member, I wrote lesson plans surrounding organizational leadership, taught instructional sessions, and directly served as a mentor for 21 students from 11 different high schools. During the 2020 summer, I worked with fellow experienced staff members to facilitate Zoom sessions for students to explore how they can recreate their school community through virtual platforms.</p>
